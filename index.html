        <h2>Call for Workshop Papers</h2>
        <p>In the dynamic landscape of communication networks, traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have been instrumental, optimizing and troubleshooting functions within communication networks. However, as 6G networks demand higher performance, traditional AI models face limitations. Breakthroughs in Generative AI (GAI) and large model, including transformer-based models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, offer the ability to support customization and data generation, introducing a new dimension to communication networks with dynamic adaptation. GAI and large model enhance content creation, network planning, and infrastructure deployment, improving efficiency and user experience. As GAI and large model integrate into next-generation networks, they drive innovation, adaptability, and personalized experiences in communication. At the same time, integrating GAI and large models into next-generation networks requires careful consideration of how to optimize the corresponding communication technologies to ensure their reliable operation and high performance. This proposed half-day workshop will seek to bring together researchers and experts from academia, industry, and governmental agencies to discuss and promote the research and development needed to overcome the major challenges that pertain to this cutting-edge research topic. Suitable topics for this workshop include, but are not limited to, the following areas:</p>

        <h2>Suitable topics include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Generative AI (GAI)/large models for vehicular networks</li>
